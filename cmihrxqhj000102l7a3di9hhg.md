For a long time, Machine Learning was that one domain I was fascinated by but too scared to touch. It felt like it was filled with complex math and intimidating algorithms.

Today, I am officially breaking my procrastination loop. This post marks **Day 0** of my journey.

**Why "Learning in Public"?**

It is dangerously easy to passively consume content without actually learning anything. I want to escape the trap of "Tutorial Hell" where you think you understand but can't build anything on your own.

This blog is my solution. Here is why I'm writing it:

* **To stay consistent:** Knowing that I have to post an update keeps me coding even when I’m tired.
    
* **To debug my understanding:** Writing about a topic forces me to find the gaps in my own knowledge.
    
* **To help others:** If I struggle with a bug, chances are someone else will too. This blog will be the resource I wish I had.
    

```python
print("Let the training begin!")
```

### What I’ll be learning?

I am keeping it practical. My focus for the next few months will be:

* **The Basics:** Python proficiency (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).
    
* **The Math:** Revisiting Linear Algebra and Statistics.
    
* **The Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
    
* **The Goal:** To move from "importing libraries" to understanding the math *behind* the import.
    

### The Commitment

I plan to share updates **Every 3 Days.**

I won't just share the victories. I’ll share the bugs, the confusion, and the messy graphs.
