# code_train_repeat.py 🐍

> **Status:** `Training in Progress... 🚀` 

Welcome to my personal Machine Learning repository. This is the central hub for my code, datasets, and experiments as I transition from a Computer Science student to a Machine Learning practitioner.

**Read the detailed blogs on [Hashnode](https://saachis-blog.hashnode.dev/series/code-train-repeat-py).**

## 📜 The Algorithm
In this series, I execute my personal learning algorithm:
1. **Input** raw theory.
2. **Process** it into working Python code.
3. **Train** models until the concepts click.

Expect raw developer logs, project breakdowns, and solutions to the inevitable bugs I find along the way.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack
My weapon of choice is Python.

* **Core:** Python 3.9+, Anaconda
* **Data Manipulation:** NumPy, Pandas
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / PyTorch (Coming Soon)
* **Tools:** VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks

## 🗺️ Planned Roadmap
I will be building this repository out module-by-module. Here is the curriculum I plan to follow:

* **Module 0:** Foundations (Python refreshers, Linear Algebra, Statistics).
* **Module 1:** Data Analysis (EDA, Cleaning, Visualization).
* **Module 2:** Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification).
* **Module 3:** Unsupervised Learning (Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction).
